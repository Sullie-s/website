      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="images/profile.jpeg" alt="Profile photo" />
      <p>Hi, I'm Sulaimon, an Electrical and Computer Engineering 
        student at The University of Texas at Austin, expecting to
        graduate in May 2026. I'm passionate about using technology
        to solve real-world problems and enhance the user experience.
        Over the past few years, I’ve had hands-on experience in software and data engineering,
        where I’ve contributed to projects involving cloud technologies, 
        full-stack development, and database management.

        I enjoy working on projects that challenge my understanding of computer systems,
        like developing simulators or creating interactive tools, and I believe in the power
        of collaboration to achieve impactful outcomes. Whether it’s improving an algorithm or 
        developing a new system, I’m eager to keep learning and pushing boundaries.</p>
